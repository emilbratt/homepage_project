<h3>My Own Website</h3>
<p>I am finally putting my project up for everyone to see/use</p>

<pre>
This is a project that is intended to teach me what components
make up a website and how the components interact with one and
another to provide features like sharing articles/posts or
uploading photos and presenting the content.

<h3>About This Project</h3>

<pre>
It has been a work in progress since March 2021.
The first 2 months have been devoted to getting this website ready.
Basic backend functionality for the php scripts to render content.
Developing Html and CSS to shape the look and feel of the website.

I will continue to develope and maintain this webpage in the hopes
that it will grow into a website that I can be proud of.
That being said, many changes will happen during this project as I
keep learning more and more about web-technologies.

For now you can track my progress by reading the "project.txt"
file provided.

Things that I intend to work on and implement is written down in
the "todo.txt" file.
