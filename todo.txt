-Implement a gallery page for photos
-Implement a way to modify any script (can only modify posts that have not been activated at this point)
-Fix undefined value when loading blogpost photo that was uploaded but canceled because it already existed
-Remove bottom closing tag for php for each php-file as adviced
-Refactor code (especially functions that mix HTML and PHP and start using alternative syntax)
    example:
    <?php
    // calculate all your variables here
    // including any program logic (loops, conditionals, etc.)
    $greeting = 'hello';
    $name = 'world';
    ?>
    <!-- now output your HTML interspersed with your calculated values from PHP -->
    <p><?= $greeting ?> <?= $name ?></p>
